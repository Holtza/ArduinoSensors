# ArduinoSensors
Arduino sketches for reading and manipulating data used in SmartCar project.

The sketches reading ultrasonic sensors rely on the Wire library to work.

Pins and addresses might need to be redefined in accordance with your wiring on the board.

Example charts with data from overtaking and parking scenarios are included in the "Example output" folder.
